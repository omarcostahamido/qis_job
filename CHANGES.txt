    - `--optimization_level` argument
	- QI API changed, qisjob now automatically picks a QI backend if none named
	- Remember to change QisJob.my_version
	- `BackendStatus` changed in Qiskit so changed `--status` code
	- Save result_exp as QisJob.result_exp
	- If -j then print job both before and after run
	- More verbosity info on Aer jobs (gpu)
	- Add `yiqing_5.qasm` to test QuantumInspire Starmon-5
	- Change `--qisjob_version` to `--version`
	- Change "master" branch to "main"
	- Update readme to make it clearer that qisjob can take input from stdin
v3.2:
	- QisJob can be instanced with qasm source using `qasm_src=` a string
	- More support for Aer gpu
	- Job monitor no longer default, if desired, `--use_job_monitor`

v3.1:
	- Created Makefile
	- Check for `JobStatus.DONE` and print error if any
	- Support qiskit-jku-provider
	- Minor typos and more error handling
	- Handle Ast2CircException
	- Protect import of IBMQ Provider with try/except
	- Now reports own version with --qisjob_version
	- If `-n` then `-v -v -v` verbosity will print unrolled circuit
	- Added `no_unknown=True` so nuqasm2 will except on unparseable

v3.0:
	- Now installable with `setup.py`
	- with `-n` switch, uses nuqasm2 to assemble qasm code
	- Command once installed is `qisjob`
	- Support for new Aer GPU simulator
	- Added switches:
		`--circuit_layout`
		`--statevector_gpu`
		`--showsched`
	- Fixed bug in returning results of multiple experiment job
	- More exception catching

v2.8:
	- Main is now `qis_job` ... `qasm_job` is gone.
	- Warn, don't fail, if QuantumInspire not installed.
	- Support for Rigetti Forest

v2.5:
    - more sample files
    - --properties now does to_dict() before pretty printing
    - -g --configuration prints backend configuration
    - -p and -g take backend name from -b switch

    - support aer unitary_simulator
    - check for counts before trying to print

v2.3:
    - refactor result handling
    - plotting state city
